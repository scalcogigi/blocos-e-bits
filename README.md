# Analyzing the Use of Visual Programming in Teaching Assembly

This project aims to explore the use of block-based visual programming as a supporting tool for teaching Assembly language. The proposal seeks to understand how the visual representation of low-level instructions can contribute to learning fundamental computer architecture concepts, reducing syntactic complexity and improving content accessibility.

The developed application integrates the Blockly environment—an open-source visual programming library—with custom Assembly and JSON code generators. This allows students to build programs by dragging and arranging visual blocks while simultaneously observing the automatic translation into Assembly code, encouraging a practical understanding of the logic behind machine-level operations.

## Educational Objective

The use of visual tools in Assembly education aims to make learning more intuitive and exploratory, promoting conceptual understanding of processes such as:

- Data movement between registers and memory;
- Execution of arithmetic and logical operations;
- Control flow mechanisms (conditional jumps and labels);
- Symbolic representation of the machine’s internal architecture.

Through this approach, the project seeks to bring students closer to the foundations of low-level programming, allowing the focus to shift from syntactic memorization to the logic and structure of instructions.

## Conclusion

The project “Analyzing the Use of Visual Programming in Teaching Assembly” proposes an innovative and interactive approach to teaching concepts traditionally considered complex. By combining block-based visualization with automatic translation to Assembly, students can incrementally understand the correspondence between high-level logic and its representation in machine-level code.
